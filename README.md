A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

Binary trees can be implemented in at least two ways: as arrays and as linked structures. To implement a tree as an array, a node is declared as a structure with an information field and two “pointer” fields. These pointer fields contain the indexes of the array cells in which the left and right children are stored, if there are any.
